# Python Lists

What are lists used for ?

You will need to see your data as chunks.

Problems are solved by manipulating lists of data. Python has a natural extension for lists.
In Python it is better to think in **lists**.

## CRUD and Beyond

Crud - create, read, update, delete

Which are the basic list operations. FIrst, you create a list, read values from the list, modify the list's contents, and
delete items from the lists.

## Hello, Multiverse !

```
greetingFromUpsideDownWorld = ['Hello', 'Regular Worlds']

```

This is an example of a "literal" definition of a list. COnsisting of a comma-separated series of values enclosed in square brackets. This lists shows two string brackets. **Lists can contain any type of value, and different types of values can be mixed together**

Python allows trailing commas. But don't do it.
