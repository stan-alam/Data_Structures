Data structures and algos are not just abstract concepts. **Mastering them enables you to write efficient code that runs faster.** 

**So what's all this fuss about Data Structures ? why do they matter ?**


Programming largely revolves around data, i.e. receiving, manipulating receiving, manipulating, and returning data. 

**Data** is may refer to all types of data from strings to basic numbers. 

## Data Structures refer to how data is organized.

Organizing data structures correctly impacts the speed of the execution of the code. A solid grasp of data Structures will allow you to write efficient fast code. 

## The Array is the foundational Data Structures

Array is one of the most basic data structures in comp science. An array is simply a list of data elements. The array is versatile, and can serve as a useful tool in many different scenarios. 

e.g.
