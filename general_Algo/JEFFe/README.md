## Data Structures and Algorithms -- Jeff Erickson Text

Preface
course in data structures and algorithms. In particular, I assume at least passing
familiarity with the following specific topics:
•
Discrete mathematics:
High-school algebra, logarithm identities, naive
set theory, Boolean algebra, first-order predicate logic, sets, functions,
equivalences, partial orders, modular arithmetic, recursive definitions, trees
(as abstract objects, not data structures), graphs (vertices and edges, not
function plots).
•
Proof techniques:
direct, indirect, contradiction, exhaustive case analysis,
and induction (especially “strong” and “structural” induction). Chapter 0
uses induction, and whenever Chapter

Iterative programming concepts:
variables, conditionals, loops, records,
indirection (addresses/pointers/references), subroutines, recursion. I do not
assume fluency in any particular programming language, but I do assume
experience with at least one language that supports both indirection and
recursion.
•
Fundamental abstract data types:
scalars, sequences, vectors, sets, stacks,
queues, maps/dictionaries, ordered maps/dictionaries, priority queues.
•
Fundamental data structures:
arrays, linked lists (single and double,
linear and circular), binary search trees, at least one form of
balanced
binary
search tree (such as AVL trees, red-black trees, treaps, skip lists, or splay
trees), hash tables, binary heaps, and most importantly, the difference
between this list and the previous list.
•
Fundamental computational problems:
elementary arithmetic, sorting,
searching, enumeration, tree traversal (preorder, inorder, postorder, level-
order, and so on).
•
Fundamental algorithms:
elementary algorism, sequential search, binary
search, sorting (selection, insertion, merge, heap, quick, radix, and so
on), breadth- and depth-first search in (at least binary) trees, and most
importantly, the difference between this list and the previous list.
•
Elementary algorithm analysis:
Asymptotic notation (

translating loops into sums and recursive calls into recurrences, evaluating
simple sums and recurrences.
•
Mathematical maturity:
facility with abstraction, formal (especially recur-
sive) definitions, and (especially inductive) proofs; writing and following
mathematical arguments; recognizing and avoiding syntactic, semantic,
and/or logical nonsense.
