## Stack

Linear abstract data structure where the elements could be added or deleted only at one end called the **top** of the stack

The elements follows  **'last in first Out Order', known as **LIFO**

In stack the element added last will be deleted first, the element that has been inserted first will be deleted last.

Insertion into the stack is called **push**

**pop** is the deletion of the element.

**If the stack is full it is said to be in **overflow state** The push operation will be rejected.

**if the stack is empty it is said to in underflow** The pop operation will be rejected.

If you insert an element first, it will be pushed into the index.[0]

if you insert a second element it will be pushed into  the index.[1]

if pop an element the second element will be deleted in the index.[1] 

THe pop operation will always delete the top of the index stack. so index.[1] will be deleted, call it again, then 

index.[0] will be deleted.
