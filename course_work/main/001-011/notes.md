How to implement Data structures from scratch :

Data Structures that are included in libraries, however, for a fundamental understanding of data structures :

It would be worthwhile to write the data structures from scratch. This will give you the **fundamental** understanding of 

data structures. 

You should be able to implement the best data structure for the problem domain. 

In Programming you have two things that are very important :

**Data

Instructions 

Write instructions to process data according to the need of the program

Data is kept in primary memory.

Data structure is just an efficient usage of this memory.

DS increases the scalability of the program.

## To be an efficient programmer, you must have a good knowledge of data structures


**Data Structures** 

We will be using the C programming language to cover data structures in depth

## Stack

Linear abstract data structure where the elements could be added or deleted only at one end called the **top** of the stack

The elements follows  **'last in first Out Order'**, known as **LIFO**

In stack the element added last will be deleted first, the element that has been inserted first will be deleted last.

Insertion into the stack is called **push**

**pop** is the deletion of the element.

**If the stack is full** it is said to be in **overflow state** The push operation will be rejected.

**if the stack is empty it is said to in underflow** The pop operation will be rejected.

If you insert an element first, it will be pushed into the index.[0]

if you insert a second element it will be pushed into  the index.[1]

if pop an element the second element will be deleted in the index.[1] 

THe pop operation will always delete the top of the index stack. so index.[1] will be deleted, call it again, then 

index.[0] will be deleted. 

**a good example is the terminal UP arrow key**

THe terminal remembers the commands : When you run a command, the command is stored in the stack. Press the Up arrow key and you will see your last command, first.

## practical stack example

for example, a text editor will use the stack, and operations on the stack ..for example ctr-z, undoes the last operation.

**a good example is the terminal UP arrow key**

THe terminal remembers the commands : When you run a command, the command is stored in the stack. Press the Up arrow key and you will see your last command, first.
