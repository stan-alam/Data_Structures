How to implement Data structures from scratch :

Data Structures that are included in libraries, however, for a fundamental understanding of data structures :

It would be worthwhile to write the data structures from scratch. This will give you the **fundamental** understanding of 

data structures. 

You should be able to implement the best data structure for the problem domain. 

In Programming you have two things that are very important :

**Data

Instructions 

Write instructions to process data according to the need of the program

Data is kept in primary memory.

Data structure is just an efficient usage of this memory.

DS increases the scalability of the program.

## To be an efficient programmer, you must have a good knowledge of data structures


**Data Structures** 

We will be using the C programming language to cover data structures in depth
